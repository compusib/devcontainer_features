# Argbash feature

Installs [argbash](https://argbash.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) into /usr/local/bin

The `version` option argument can be looked up here [release page][argbashReleasePage]

The `installPrefix` does not include the `bin` directory, that one is added by the install script. This just sets the `PREFIX=` make file argument, as described in the docs
